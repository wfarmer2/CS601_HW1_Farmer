                    <p>
                        I attended Arizona State University (ASU) where I earned a B.S. in Business Data Analytics 
                        and a B.S. in Marketing in May 2020. While I was attending ASU, I was heavily involved in the
                        Department of Information Systems Club (DISC) that was focused on professional development within
                        the business and technology space, respectively. Through DISC I was able to network with classmates, 
                        university alum, company representatives, and even compete in a national data competition where my team 
                        placed 2nd in Data Graphics. To learn more about the data competition, please click this

                        to call myself a Sun Devil!

            <h2>Graduate Education Background</h2>
                <img src="..\images\bu_logo.png" alt="Boston University school logo"

                    <p>
                        After starting my career directly after graduating from Arizona State University (ASU), I decided to further
                        enrich my education by enrolling in the M.S. in Software Development program at Boston University (BU). Recently,
                        I have also enrolled in the Certificate in Web Application Development alongside my degree program. The main reason
                        I chose BU for my graduate studies is fot the flexible online program that the university offers and the wonderful faculty 
                        and staff that help operate the program. Through my learning I have strengthened my current skills, developed new skills,
                        and deepened my knowledge within programming and technology in general. My planned graduation date is May of 2023 and I cannot
                        wait to be able to celebrate my accomplishments in Boston, Massachusetts in the summer!
